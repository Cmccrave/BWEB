# BWEB
## BWEB is currently v0.2
Broodwar Easy Builder or BWEB for short, is a BWEM based building placement addon that creates blocks of buildings for simple placement of all building types. BWEB started as a choice to switch to a standardized approach to placing buildings in a consistent method that allows for optimizing the space you have, something that Broodwar bots struggle with.

BWEB is created by Christian McCrave and Daniel Maize.
